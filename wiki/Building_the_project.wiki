#summary Building the project

= Introduction =
This project is composed of native code and java code. This is why you need both the Android NDK and the Android SDK to build the application. This page will briefly explain how to setup a build environment.

= Prerequisites =
 * Download and install [http://www.cygwin.com cygwin] if you are running Windows. You should at least select the package "make".
 * Download and install the [http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/1.6_r1/index.html Android NDK].
 * Download and install the [http://developer.android.com/index.html Android SDK].
 * Install [http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html Eclipse with ADT plugin].
 * Install a svn client

= Checkout sources =
Go to the _Android NDK root directory/apps_, and checkout the sources:
{{{
$ svn checkout http://android-serialport-api.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/android-serialport-api android-serialport-api
}}}
*It is important that the sources are placed inside the _apps_ directory of the NDK.*

= Building serial_port.so =
 * All commands must be typed from the NDK root directory.
 * Configure and check the NDK installation (This step not required on ndk-r6 on MacOS)
{{{
$ build/host-setup.sh
}}} 
 * Build the project
{{{
$ make APP=android-serialport-api
}}}

= Building the apk =
 * Check that the library (libserial_port.so) has been generated from previous step
{{{
$ ls apps/android-serialport-api/project/libs/armeabi
}}}
 * Import the project as an Android application inside Eclipse
 * Build and launch as usual
